### What's this about?

This blog is a dedicated space to share some of my thoughts on football(soccer) from a data driven perspective. This type of format seems to meet my need for a structured, formal and longer form environment compared to Tweeting.
***
Posts will be dedicated sharing thoughts on football from a data driven perspective with a special emphasis on data visualization. I won't limit the scope of what topics may feature, however they are likely to be mostly descriptive and observational in nature.  At the very least, reoccurring themes will probably include the following:
>  **Football data analysis and visualization**
  > * Canadian Women's National Team ([CanWNT/CanXNT](https://https://www.canadasoccer.com/national-teams/women-nt-program/))
  > * Canadian Men's National Team ([CanMNT](https://www.canadasoccer.com/national-teams/men-nt-program/))
  > * Canadian players domestic or abroad (but folks at [Canucks Abroad/At home](http://www.canucks-abroad.ca/) do great work already on this!)
  > * Canadian domestic leagues/clubs (i.e. [Canadian Premier League](https://Canpl.ca))
> * Anything else my mood and motivation throw at me!
  

### What Next/First Content

New posts can be found on the top bar under ***Posts*** or on the front page. Check out my first piece here!

I've never had a website/blog before so I'm not really sure how often I'll add new content to this hobby. I'm just thrilled to have put it together as a first objective I set out last month. As a relatively novice [R](https://www.r-project.org/) user, I had a blast learning and using [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown) for the first time to get this up and running.
